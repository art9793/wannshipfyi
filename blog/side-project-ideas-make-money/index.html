    <article class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 blog-prose">

      <p>You have a list of side project ideas in Notion. Maybe 10. Maybe 30. None of them are making money.</p>

      <p>That is the default outcome for most builders. They pick an idea that sounds cool, spend three months building it, launch to crickets, and move on to the next shiny thing. The problem is not a lack of ideas. The problem is picking ideas that nobody will pay for.</p>

      <p>This article gives you 12 research-backed side project ideas that make money right now. Not hypothetical "wouldn't it be cool if" concepts, but products where real founders are generating real recurring revenue. I have organized them by skill level (developers, no-code builders, and marketers) so you can find something that matches what you can actually build.</p>

      <p>If you want a broader list, check out our full breakdown of <a href="/blog/micro-saas-ideas/">micro-SaaS ideas</a> with revenue proof. Before you pick anything, you should know how to validate your idea before sinking weeks into building. And if you are weighing whether to build a product or keep freelancing, read our take on micro-SaaS vs freelancing.</p>

      <p>First, why most side projects die, and the framework to make yours survive.</p>

      <!-- Section: Why Most Side Projects Fail -->
      <h2 id="why-most-fail">Why Most Side Projects Fail (And How to Fix It)</h2>

      <p>The typical side project follows a familiar path: inspiration, excitement, building, building, building, launching, silence, abandonment. The builder blames distribution or timing. But the real failure happened on day one.</p>

      <p>Most side projects fail because they start with a technology instead of a problem. "I want to build something with AI." "I want to learn Next.js." These are learning goals, not business goals. There is nothing wrong with building for learning. But if you want a side project that makes money, you need to start from the opposite direction.</p>

      <h3>Three failure patterns</h3>

      <p><strong>1. Building for yourself instead of a buyer.</strong> Your personal frustration is not always a market. You might hate how your calendar app works. That does not mean thousands of people will pay $15/month for your alternative. The ideas that work target specific audiences who are already spending money on inferior solutions.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Overbuilding before validating.</strong> You do not need user accounts, a billing system, and 14 features to test if people want what you are making. The founders making $5K-$20K MRR from side projects shipped embarrassingly simple first versions. An ugly landing page with a waitlist tells you more than a polished product with zero interest.</p>

      <p><strong>3. No distribution plan from day one.</strong> "Build it and they will come" has never worked. Before you write a single line of code, you need to know where your customers hang out. Which subreddits? Which Slack communities? If you cannot answer that, you are not ready to build.</p>

      <p>Every idea in this article passes a simple test: someone is already paying for it, there is a clear audience you can reach, and a solo builder can ship it in weeks, not months.</p>

      <!-- Section: Revenue-First Framework -->
      <h2 id="revenue-first-framework">The Revenue-First Framework</h2>

      <p>Before you pick from the list below, run every idea through this four-part filter. It takes 30 minutes and saves you months of wasted work.</p>

      <h3>1. Demand proof</h3>
      <p>Is someone already paying for a solution to this problem? Look for existing competitors with paying customers, Reddit threads asking for recommendations, or people complaining about current tools. Competition is a good sign. It means there is money in the market.</p>

      <h3>2. Audience access</h3>
      <p>Can you reach 1,000 potential buyers without paid ads? This means specific communities, forums, social platforms, or email lists where your target audience gathers. If the only distribution channel is "run Facebook ads," move on.</p>

      <h3>3. Scope control</h3>
      <p>Can a solo builder ship a useful v1 in 2-6 weeks? The best side projects start narrow. A PDF invoice generator, not a full accounting suite. A niche job board for one industry, not a LinkedIn competitor. Small scope is the strategy, not a limitation.</p>

      <h3>4. Revenue path</h3>
      <p>How does this make money from month one? Subscription, one-time purchase, or marketplace cut. You need a pricing model before you build, not after. If you cannot charge for the MVP, the idea is wrong.</p>

      <p>Here are 12 ideas that pass all four filters.</p>

      <!-- Section: Developer Ideas -->
      <h2 id="ideas-for-developers">4 Side Project Ideas for Developers</h2>

      <p>These ideas need some coding ability, from browser extension development to API integrations. If you can build with JavaScript, Python, or any backend language, these are in your wheelhouse.</p>

      <!-- Idea 1 -->
      <h3>1. Chrome Extension for Productivity</h3>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-800/50 bg-zinc-900/30 p-5 mb-6">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-sm">
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">MRR:</strong> $3-5K</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Build:</strong> 2-4 weeks</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Type:</strong> Browser extension</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Level:</strong> Beginner</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Browser extensions do not get enough attention as a side project category. The Chrome Web Store has 200,000+ extensions, but most are abandoned, ugly, or bloated. There is room for clean, focused tools that do one thing well.</p>

      <p>Think tab management, distraction blocking, or workflow automation for a specific profession. An extension that saves remote workers 20 minutes per day is worth $5-10/month to them. The distribution advantage is built in: the Chrome Web Store itself drives organic traffic once you get reviews.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> The extension ecosystem is mature but not saturated at the niche level. You can build an MVP with basic JavaScript and the Chrome Extension API in under two weeks. Monetize through a freemium model: free tier for basic features, paid for power-user functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> ProductHunt, r/chrome, r/productivity, developer Slack communities, Twitter/X threads about browser workflows.</p>

      <h3>2. AI Brand Mention Tracker</h3>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-800/50 bg-zinc-900/30 p-5 mb-6">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-sm">
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">MRR:</strong> $20K</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Build:</strong> 4-6 weeks</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Type:</strong> API tool</span>

      <p>Every marketing team is asking the same question: "What is ChatGPT saying about our brand?" As more people use AI search, companies need to know how they show up in AI-generated responses across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.</p>

      <p>This is a monitoring tool that queries AI models with industry-relevant prompts and tracks how often (and how accurately) a brand gets mentioned. The output is a dashboard showing mention frequency, sentiment, and competitor comparisons.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> This category barely existed a year ago. Early entrants are already at $20K MRR because marketing teams want this and very few tools exist yet. If you can build API integrations, you can ship this.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> Marketing Twitter/X, SaaS Slack communities, LinkedIn posts about AI SEO, cold outreach to SaaS marketing teams.</p>

      <div class="border-t border-zinc-800/30 mt-10 pt-2"></div>
      <!-- Idea 3 -->
      <h3>3. Cold Email Tool for Agencies</h3>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-800/50 bg-zinc-900/30 p-5 mb-6">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-sm">
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">MRR:</strong> $15-25K</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Build:</strong> 4-6 weeks</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Type:</strong> SaaS</span>

      <p>Agencies live and die by outbound. Every agency founder has the same pain: managing cold email campaigns across multiple client accounts, warming up domains, and tracking deliverability.</p>

      <p>The existing tools (Instantly, Smartlead) are growing fast, which proves the market size. But agencies have specific needs that the general tools handle poorly: multi-client management, white-labeling, and team seats. That is the opening.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> Outbound keeps getting more competitive, which means agencies need better tooling. They will pay $99-299/month for a tool that manages their outreach infrastructure. Build the agency-specific features that general-purpose tools skip.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> Agency owner communities on Slack, r/Entrepreneur, agency Facebook groups, cold DM campaigns on LinkedIn targeting agency founders.</p>

      <h3>4. E-commerce Analytics Dashboard</h3>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-800/50 bg-zinc-900/30 p-5 mb-6">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-sm">
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">MRR:</strong> $10-20K</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Build:</strong> 5-6 weeks</span>

      <p>Shopify store owners have data spread across 8 different tools. Google Analytics. Shopify's native reports. Facebook Ads Manager. Klaviyo. They need a single dashboard that pulls everything together and shows them what actually matters: which products are profitable and which marketing channels are working.</p>

      <p>This is a connector product. You build integrations with the major e-commerce tools and present a unified view. The hard part is not the dashboard; it is building reliable data pipelines.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> The Shopify ecosystem keeps growing, and store owners will pay $49-149/month for a tool that shows them where their money is going. The Shopify App Store is your primary distribution channel.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> Shopify App Store (built-in distribution), r/shopify, e-commerce Facebook groups, Twitter/X DTC community.</p>

      <h2 id="ideas-for-no-code">4 Side Project Ideas for No-Code Builders</h2>

      <p>You do not need to write code to build a profitable side project. These ideas can be built with tools like Bubble, Softr, Airtable, Carrd, and Zapier. The key is picking a specific niche and executing well.</p>

      <!-- Idea 5 -->
      <h3>5. PDF Invoice Generator</h3>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-800/50 bg-zinc-900/30 p-5 mb-6">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-sm">
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">MRR:</strong> $2-5K</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Build:</strong> 2-3 weeks</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Type:</strong> SaaS</span>

      <p>Freelancers and small businesses create invoices every single week. Most of them hate their current process: Word templates, free generators with watermarks, or overpriced accounting software they only need for invoicing.</p>

      <p>A clean, fast invoice generator that lets you enter details, pick a template, and download a branded PDF is all it takes. Add recurring invoices and payment tracking and you have a tool people will pay $9-19/month for.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> More people freelance every year. They leave jobs, start consulting, and immediately need to send invoices. New customers enter this market every day.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> r/freelance, freelancer Facebook groups, Upwork community forums, Twitter/X freelance community.</p>

      <p>General-purpose job boards are dominated by Indeed and LinkedIn. But niche job boards focused on a single industry or role do surprisingly well. RemoteOK for remote jobs, Wellfound for startup jobs. The pattern repeats.</p>

      <p>Pick an underserved niche: climate tech, AI/ML roles, healthcare startups, or any vertical where job seekers and employers want a focused platform. The business model is simple. Charge employers $99-299 to post a job listing.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> You can build a job board with no code using tools like Pallet, Softr + Airtable, or even a Notion-powered site. The barrier to entry is low, but the barrier to quality is what creates your moat. Curate hard. Only accept relevant postings.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> Industry-specific Slack groups, subreddits for your chosen niche, LinkedIn groups, and newsletters in the vertical.</p>

      <h3>7. Quit Vaping App</h3>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-800/50 bg-zinc-900/30 p-5 mb-6">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-sm">
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">MRR:</strong> $3-5K</span>
          <span><strong class="text-amber-400 font-mono">Build:</strong> 2-3 weeks</span>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Most builders overlook health behavior change. Millions of people want to quit vaping but there are almost no dedicated digital tools for it. The quit-smoking app market proved the model. Apps like Smoke Free generate millions in revenue, and the vaping-specific niche has barely been touched.</p>

      <p>Build a tracker that counts vape-free days, calculates money saved, offers daily motivation, and connects users to a community. The subscription model works here because the user's problem is ongoing.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> Vaping is a growing public health concern with high search volume and almost no dedicated solutions. You can build this with no-code tools (Glide, Adalo, FlutterFlow) and monetize at $4.99-9.99/month or a $29.99 annual plan.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> r/QuitVaping, health-focused TikTok content, Facebook quit-vaping support groups, App Store organic search.</p>

      <p>Airtable has 300,000+ paying customers who constantly need to connect their bases to other tools. The native integrations cover the basics, but teams need specific workflows: syncing Airtable to their CRM, pushing data to Slack in custom formats, generating reports from Airtable data.</p>

      <p>Build a focused integration between Airtable and one popular tool (Slack, HubSpot, Notion, Google Sheets) that solves a specific workflow better than Zapier does. The Airtable Marketplace is your built-in distribution channel.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> Airtable users are power users who pay for tools that save them time. Price at $9-29/month per workspace. You can build the integration layer using Airtable's API and Make/Zapier as your backend if you prefer no-code.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> Airtable community forums, Airtable Marketplace, r/Airtable, no-code communities on Twitter/X and Slack.</p>

      <p>LinkedIn organic reach for B2B is still strong relative to other platforms. Lots of founders and professionals post daily, but the tooling around LinkedIn content is weak. Most people write posts in their notes app and copy-paste them.</p>

      <p>Build a tool that helps people write, schedule, format, and analyze LinkedIn posts. Include features like carousel creation, hook templates, and engagement analytics. The founders already in this space are at $62K MRR, which tells you the demand is real.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> LinkedIn organic reach is still strong, and the platform keeps growing. Creators and founders will pay $19-49/month for a tool that helps them grow their audience. You can build the core experience with no code and add features over time.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> LinkedIn itself (obviously), creator communities, solopreneur Slack groups, Twitter/X founder community.</p>

      <p>Freelancers manage clients in spreadsheets, sticky notes, and scattered email threads. HubSpot and Salesforce are overkill. What freelancers actually need is a simple system: track leads, send proposals, and follow up on overdue payments. All in one place.</p>

      <p>The CRM market is enormous, but nobody has nailed the freelancer-specific version. Keep it dead simple. No enterprise features. Just the exact workflow a solo freelancer or small agency runs every week.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> New freelancers start every day and immediately need a system to manage clients. Price at $15-29/month. The simplicity is the selling point, not a limitation.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> r/freelance, freelancer Twitter/X, Upwork community, design and dev community Slacks, cold DMs to freelancers who post about client management pain.</p>

      <h3>11. AI SEO Content Brief Generator</h3>

      <p>Content marketers and SEO agencies create content briefs before every article. It is tedious: research target keywords, analyze top-ranking pages, identify content gaps, and structure the outline. This process takes 1-2 hours per brief.</p>

      <p>An AI-powered tool that generates a complete content brief in minutes saves serious time. Keyword targets, competitor analysis, suggested headers, internal linking opportunities. Agencies creating 20+ briefs per month will pay $49-99/month without blinking.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> Content marketing is not slowing down, and AI makes it possible to automate the research-heavy parts of brief creation. You can build this by combining an LLM API with SEO data from sources like Google Search Console or third-party APIs.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> SEO Twitter/X, content marketing Slack communities, r/SEO, agency owner groups, LinkedIn content about SEO workflows.</p>

      <p>Yes, Buffer and Hootsuite exist. They also serve everyone, from enterprise marketing teams to solo creators. That is the opening. A scheduler built specifically for solo creators or a single platform (like Twitter-only or LinkedIn-only) can carve out a profitable niche.</p>

      <p>The top indie social media schedulers are hitting $74K MRR by focusing on simplicity and a specific audience. They do not try to be Buffer. They try to be the best tool for one type of user.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this works now:</strong> Solo creators want affordable, simple tools, not enterprise dashboards. Price at $9-29/month. The longer build time (6-8 weeks) is offset by a proven market with strong recurring revenue.</p>

      <p><strong>Where to find customers:</strong> Creator communities, Twitter/X, IndieHackers, solopreneur Slack groups, ProductHunt launch.</p>

      <!-- Section: Validation Checklist -->
      <h2 id="validation-checklist">The Side Project Validation Checklist</h2>

      <p>Now here is how to pick the right one and validate it before you build. Run through this checklist in a single weekend.</p>

      <h3>Weekend validation sprint</h3>

      <p><strong>Saturday morning, demand research (2 hours):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search Reddit for your idea's problem. Are people asking for solutions? How many upvotes on those posts?</li>
        <li>Check if competitors exist. If yes, read their reviews. What do customers complain about? That is your angle.</li>
        <li>Search Google Trends for the core keyword. Is demand stable, growing, or dying?</li>
        <li>Look for the idea on ProductHunt. How did similar launches perform?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Saturday afternoon, audience mapping (2 hours):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>List 5 specific communities where your target customers hang out (subreddits, Slack groups, Discord servers).</li>
        <li>Check the size and activity level of each community. Dead communities mean dead distribution.</li>
        <li>Find 10 real people who have the problem. DM them. Ask: "Would you pay $X/month for a tool that does Y?"</li>
        <li>If you cannot find 10 people to talk to, the audience is too hard to reach. Move on.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Sunday, landing page test (4 hours):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a simple landing page describing the product (Carrd, a single HTML page, or Notion). Do not build the product.</li>
        <li>Include a clear value proposition, features list, price, and a "Join Waitlist" or "Pre-order" button.</li>
        <li>Share the page in 2-3 of those communities. Track how many people sign up or click.</li>
        <li>If 20+ people sign up in a weekend, you have validation. Build it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The kill criteria</h3>

      <p>Be honest with yourself. Drop the idea if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You cannot find 5 communities where your target audience gathers.</li>
        <li>Nobody responds to your DMs about the problem.</li>
        <li>You cannot articulate how the product makes money from day one.</li>
        <li>The MVP would take more than 6 weeks to ship.</li>
        <li>The only distribution strategy involves paid ads.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Killing a bad idea early is not failure. It is efficiency. The people making real money from side projects validate fast and only build the ideas that survive the checklist.</p>

      <!-- Section: What to Do Next -->
      <h2 id="what-to-do-next">What to Do Next</h2>

      <p>You have 12 side project ideas organized by what you can actually build, a framework for evaluating any idea, and a weekend validation checklist to test before you commit.</p>

      <p>The hardest part is not finding the idea. It is committing to one and shipping it. Most builders stay in research mode forever because picking feels risky. But the real risk is spending another six months browsing Reddit for ideas while someone else ships the product you were thinking about.</p>

      <p>Pick one idea from this list. Run the validation checklist this weekend. If it passes, start building on Monday.</p>

      <p>The 12 ideas above are a starting point. If you want the full picture, 50 research-backed ideas with complete build playbooks, pricing strategies, and exact channels to find your first paying customers, that is what we built WannaShip for.</p>
